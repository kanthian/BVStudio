[LX Studio](http://lx.studio/) is a digital lighting workstation, bringing concepts from digital audio workstations and modular synthesis into the realm of LED lighting control. Generative patterns, interactive inputs, and flexible parameter-driven modulation â€” a rich environment for lighting composition and performance.

### Getting Started ###

LX Studio runs using the Processing 3 framework. This version of the project directly embeds those dependencies and may be run from within a Java IDE,
for larger projects in which the Processing IDE is insufficient. The example project here can be run either using the full Processing-based UI,
or alternatively in a headless CLI-only mode.

To get started, clone this repository and import the project into an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ. Configuration files for both are readily
available in the repository.

Consult the [LX Studio API reference &rarr;](http://lx.studio/api/)
